Train LSTM per author instead of general one
Add dropout
Lower learning rate and increase epochs
Regex for years, dollars, nums
Try different sequence_lengths
Add features that LSTM can't see because of embeddings: avg word length, unique ratio of words (not there cuz UNK words)

Work done with dataset and author Id and verify
